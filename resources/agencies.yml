# ===Transport===
# The [[Department of Transport (Victoria)|Department of Transport]] (DOT) supports three Ministerial portfolios, the Minister for Public Transport, the Minister for Roads and the Minister for Ports. It also supports one Parliamentary Secretary for Transport.
#
# ==== Overview ====
# Most State transport agencies are established under the [[Transport Integration Act]].  The [[Department of Transport (Victoria)|DOT]] oversees and coordinates the activities of the agencies which can be divided into three main types - statutory offices, statutory authorities and independent transport safety agencies.
#
# Together with [[Department of Transport (Victoria)|DOT]], the agencies provide, manage and regulate transport system activities in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] including -
# * heavy and light rail systems including trains and trams
# * roads systems and vehicles including cars, trucks and bicycles
# * ports and waterways including commercial ships<ref>Note, some shipping matters are controlled by the Commonwealth under legislation such as the Navigation Act 1912.  Other matters are within the jurisdiction of states such as [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] through Acts such as the [[Transport Integration Act]] and other statutes like the Marine Act 1988.</ref> and recreational vessels
# * some air transport systems.<ref>Note, many air transport regulation matters are controlled by the Commonwealth Government.  The [[Transport Integration Act]] would apply, for example, to planning controls at some airports and in respect of transport connections to other airports by road and rail.</ref>
#
# ===== Statutory offices =====
# The statutory offices include -
# * the [[Director of Public Transport]]
# * the Transport Infrastructure Development Agent.
#
# These agencies are part of the Department of Transport but each has a distinct statutory charter and powers.<ref>For information relating to the [[Director of Public Transport]], see Division 1 of Part 5 of the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].  The charter and powers of the Transport Infrastructure Development Agent are set out in Division 4 of Part 3 of the Transport Integration Act 2010.</ref>
#
# ===== Statutory authorities =====
# The statutory authorities<ref>See Parts 5 and 6, [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].</ref> are -
# * the [[VicRoads|Roads Corporation (VicRoads)]]
# * [[Public Transport Victoria]]
# * the [[Taxi Services Commission]]
# * [[VicTrack|Victorian Rail Track (VicTrack)]]
# * [[V/Line|V/Line Corporation (V/Line)]]
# * the Linking Melbourne Authority
# * the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]]
# * the [[Port of Hastings Development Authority]]
# * the Victorian Regional Channels Authority
# * the [[Transport Ticketing Authority]]
# * the Regional Rail Link Authority
#
# These agencies are structurally separate from the [[Department of Transport (Victoria)|Department of Transport]].<ref>The Act establishes these agencies as structurally separate bodies with their own legal personality.  For example, section 81(4) of the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]] establishes VicRoads as a "body corporate" which "may do and suffer all acts and things that a body corporate may by law do and suffer".</ref>
#
# In July 2016, the government announced the creation of [[Transport for Victoria]], a new statutory authority combining planning functions of Public Transport Victoria and VicRoads as well as functions of other agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/a-simpler-more-coordinated-transport-system-for-victoria/|title=A Simpler, More Coordinated Transport System For Victoria|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>
#
# ===== Independent transport safety agencies =====

# * the [[Director, Transport Safety|Director, Transport Safety (Transport Safety Victoria)]]
# * the [[Chief Investigator, Transport Safety]].
#
# These agencies are part of the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] but are functionally independent and report to the relevant Ministers.<ref>Section 194, [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].</ref>

#
# ===Treasury and Finance===
# * The [[Department of Treasury and Finance]] provides policy advice to the Victorian Government on economic, financial and resource management, supporting the delivery of its financially responsible and socially progressive policy platform.
# * [[Financial Reform Division]]
# * The Department formulates and implements the Government’s longer-term economic and budgetary objectives, which are to achieve economic growth for all regions of the State and increase the living standards of all Victorians.
